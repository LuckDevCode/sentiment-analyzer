# Sentiment Analyzer

This project implements an intelligent sentiment analysis system capable of interpreting emotions expressed in text. The goal is to develop a system that initially classifies texts as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. In a future stage, it will be enhanced to differentiate more specific emotions such as **happiness**, **sadness**, **anxiety**, and others.

The project will be developed in two main phases:

---

## ðŸ“˜ Phase 1 â€“ Sentiment Classification + REST API (FastAPI)

- Build an AI model that classifies input text into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.
- Deploy a RESTful API using **FastAPI** with an endpoint for analyzing text.
- Provide clear documentation (Swagger UI) for easy interaction and testing.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Phase 2 â€“ Emotion Detection + Interactive Interface

- Upgrade the AI model to detect **specific emotions** (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety, etc.).
- Develop a **web interface** to interact with the model in a user-friendly way.
- Optional: deploy the application using platforms like **Streamlit**, **Gradio**, or **Hugging Face Spaces**.
